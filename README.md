# osudle!

osudle! is a osu guessing game heavily inspired by guessthe.game. The objective of the game is to guess the map in the fewest tries. See if you can guess the map just from the rhythm and patterns!

A new map comes out every day at 7:27pm PST.

You can access this project and try it yourself at https://osudle.com
